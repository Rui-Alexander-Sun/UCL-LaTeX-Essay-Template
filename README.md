## Acknowledgement

I first learned about $\LaTeX$ when I was in my senior year and busy preparing my resume for master application. I was fascinated by its magic and decided to apply it to my undergraduate thesis. Surprisingly, I found that there has been a very exquisite template on Github for undergraduates from Sun Yat-sen University, compared to which, what I have done just look like the simpliest stick figure drawn by a preschooler to kill time in a tedious afternoon. Mank thanks to [sysu-thesis](https://github.com/SYSU-SCC/sysu-thesis) for not only the template itself, but also the knwoledge about $\LaTeX$ and Github I have gained from it.

## Feedback & Improvement

As I am still learning about both $\LaTeX$ and Github, there may be a lot of errors and shortcomings in these files. If anything goes wrong or more features required, please report in "Issues" or [email me](mailto:r.sun.22@ucl.ac.uk) directly.
