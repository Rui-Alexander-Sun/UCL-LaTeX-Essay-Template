\section{Heading Level 1}

This template defaults to the Times New Roman font with a size of 12pt. The first line is indented by 0.5 inches. All lines are double-spaced. 

\noindent If needed, type "\textbackslash noindent" before each paragraph to unindent.

\subsection{Heading Level 2}

You could use the "\textbackslash parencite$["$page\_number(s)$"]$\{\}" command to include both author name and publish year in brackets and the "\textbackslash textcite\{\}" command to include only publish year in brackets. 


E.g.1, \textcite{lshort} wrote a comprehensive introduction to \LaTeX.

E.g.2, Using \TeX \ as its typesetter, \LaTeX \ is developed to help authors produce high-quality manuscripts \parencite[1-2]{lshort}.
